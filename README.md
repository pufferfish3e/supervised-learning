# Supervised-Learning Project

A supervised-learning tutorial project containing both regression and classification examples written in Python.

## Project Description

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the end-to-end workflow of supervised learning.
It includes examples of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
The goal is to provide a clear starting point for anyone learning machine learning basics.

## Technologies and Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

(Full dependencies are located in requirements.txt.)

## Repository Structure

classification.ipynb
    Demonstrates a classification workflow example.

Regression.ipynb
    Demonstrates a regression workflow example.

requirements.txt
    List of Python package dependencies.

Slides.pptx
    Presentation or documentation related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/pufferfish3e/supervised-learning.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

4. Open either classification.ipynb or Regression.ipynb to explore the workflows.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- How to prepare data for supervised machine learning tasks
- Training simple regression and classification models
- Evaluating model performance
- Understanding differences between regression and classification problems

## Potential Improvements

- Add more models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or KNN
- Include visualization of decision boundaries or regression fits
- Add a dataset folder with sample data
- Add confusion matrices, learning curves, and additional evaluation metrics
